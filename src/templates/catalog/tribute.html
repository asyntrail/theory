    <li><b>1900</b> - –êccompanied his father to Germany and through conversations with his father, became interested in natural sciences. After returning home, Sikorsky began to experiment with model flying machines, and by age 12, he had made a small rubber band-powered helicopter.</li>
  <li><b>1903</b> - Sikorsky began studying at the Saint Petersburg Maritime Cadet Corps, at the age of 14.</li>

     <li><b>1928</b> - Sikorsky became a naturalized citizen of the United States.The Sikorsky Manufacturing Company moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 1929. It became a part of the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (now United Technologies Corporation).</li>

     <li><b>1942</b> - Sikorsky's success with the VS-300 led to the R-4, which became the world's first mass-produced helicopter. </li>
